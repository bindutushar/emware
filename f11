                                         GENERAL QUESTIONS
1)WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMAL C AND EMBEDED C ?
A) NORMAL C:-
1) c is type of computer programming language .
2) c is used for desktop applications , c is os dependent.
3) c language program is hardware independent.
4)in the c programming language, we can use standard functions like printf(), scanf() ..etc for output and input.
5)some of the examples of applications logical programs, and system software programs. EX:- GCC (GNU COMPLIER COLLECTION),TURBO C,C++ COMPLIER
  EMBEDED C :-
1)while embeded  c is a set of language extensions for the c programming language.
2)used for microprocessor/microcontroller applications.
3) can work with (or)without an operating system.
4)embedded  c program is hardware dependent.
5)embedded  c is there is standard library functions like monitor ,keyboard …etc
You have to write code to display output to connected display unit like 16*2lcd, graphics display.
6) some of the examples of real time applications : DVD,  TV, digital camera,

2)WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BIG ENDIAN AND LITTLE ENDIAN ?
A)LITTLE ENDIAN :- lower order byte of data is stored lower order address and higer order byte of data is stored higer order address.
EX:- 0X11223344
Address   100    200   300   400
Data          11      22      33     44
 BIG ENDIAN :-lower order byte of data is stored higer order address and higer order byte is stored lower order address.
EX :-0X11223344
Address   100     200     300     400
Data          44       33        22       11
